# TODO:
# - Could there be a way to test for a distinct shapes namespace?
# - Could there be a way to test for a freestanding property shape?
# - Could there be a way to test if every class is mirrored by a shape?

# this is as close we can get to the semantics of the rule
# i.e. any other type declared implies the shape is an extension
# TODO:
# - Also reproduce this for DatatypeProperty, ObjectProperty?
# - Could there be a better way to express that something cannot be both?
